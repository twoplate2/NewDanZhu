/**
 * Pure-Java readiness gate for SoundPool samples.
 *
 * ASCII ONLY, on purpose: javac's default source encoding on the build machine is
 * not guaranteed to be UTF-8, and one non-ASCII byte in a comment can fail the
 * whole APK build.  (Chinese notes about this class live in buildozer.spec.)
 *
 * Why this class exists
 * ---------------------
 * SoundPool.load() is asynchronous: a returned sampleId does NOT mean the sample
 * is decoded yet.  SoundPool.play() on a not-yet-ready sample returns 0 and does
 * nothing at all -- no exception, no log.  So the game must confirm that all 101
 * samples are playable before it dismisses the loading page.
 *
 * Confirming that by calling play() once per sample is what costs the time: on
 * some devices play() creates and starts an AudioTrack on the CALLING thread
 * (AOSP StreamManager kPlayOnCallingThread == true on Android 11..14), and
 * Stream.cpp only reuses an AudioTrack for the SAME soundID.  101 distinct
 * samples therefore means 101 track creations: measured 29..33 ms each, i.e.
 * about 3 seconds, on a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 / Android 13.
 *
 * OnLoadCompleteListener is the official "this sample is decoded" signal and it
 * costs nothing.  The app avoided it before because of the pyjnius bridge: a
 * Python object registered as a Java listener can be collected, or called from a
 * thread that is not attached to the JVM, and either failure would be silent.
 * This class removes that bridge -- the listener is a Java object, the counting
 * happens in Java, and Python only makes short down-calls that read plain ints.
 *
 * Threading: setOnLoadCompleteListener() creates its Handler on the calling
 * thread's Looper, or on the main Looper when the calling thread has none.  We
 * are called from a Python worker thread, which has no Looper, so callbacks are
 * delivered on the main (UI) thread.  That Handler holds this listener strongly,
 * so there is no GC hazard.
